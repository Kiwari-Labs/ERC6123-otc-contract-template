# ERC6123-otc-contract-template

## Overview

The `ERC6123-otc-contract-template` represents a smart contract library for adopting `over-the-counter`or `OTC` trade on blockchain. It bridges traditional contract workflow and its principles with programmable, self-executing agreements, commonly referred to as smart contracts. This template can serve as a guideline for constructing `OTC` trade of `ERC-20` between two parties.
